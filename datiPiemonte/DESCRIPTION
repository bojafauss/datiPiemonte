Description: A package to simplify access to the opendata portal of the Piedmont region.
    More or less inspired by the Eurostat R package.
    It currently supports only datasets hosted on the Yucca platform, but feel free to contribute.
    I wrote it real quick, so there are a lot of dependencies that would be nice to remove.
